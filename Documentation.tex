    \texttt{IsLeapYear} is a function that returns true if a the input year is a leap year, and false if it is not a
    leap year. We achieve this with a series of four boolean statements. First, we discard any input that pre-dates
    1582. Next it is assessed whether the input is simultaneously divisible by 100 and 400, this is a leap year and so
    \texttt{IsLeapYear}. Thereafter we discard any years that are dibisible by only 100. Finally, return true if the input
    is divisible by 4, and false otherwise.
